# equilibre

App for managing health clinic with multiple independent practicioners (psychologists, nutritionists, physical therapists and doctors) sharing office space.

Since this app is heavily based in calendar and other user interactions, it was designed to be a client-based angular app with the help of fullcalendar (fullcalendar.io). The backend will consist of a simple API to store and retrieve data.
