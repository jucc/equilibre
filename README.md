# equilibre

App for managing healthy lifestyle clinic with multiple independent practicioners (psychologists, nutritionists, physical therapists and doctors) sharing office space.

Since the app is heavily based in calendar and other user interactions it is designed to be a client based angular app with the help of fullcalendar (fullcalendar.io). The backend will consist of a simple API to store and retrieve data.
